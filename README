PolymorphicCpp github repository information.
2010-07-19

This repository contains a number of classes and functions that demonstrate some
of the trickier polymorphic behaviour of C++. The code is heavily inspired by
Richard Gillam's articles on the assignment operator. They can be found at:

http://icu-project.org/docs/papers/cpp_report/the_anatomy_of_the_assignment_operator.html
http://icu-project.org/docs/papers/cpp_report/the_assignment_operator_revisited.html

Each of the source files in this repository is stand-alone and compiles with an
installation of stdc++.

'same_type_assignment.cpp' demonstrates how polymorphic assignment can be
implemented if you know you will only ever assign classes of the same type.
